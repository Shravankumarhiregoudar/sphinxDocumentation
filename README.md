The code documentation is essential in every project. Code documentation can be split into multiple parts. The first one is comment blocks, most helpful for programmers; These will be found through every file explaining classes, methods, parameters, possible errors. Then comes the file documentations. These are usually generated through a script that will parse a file and, based on the description in the docstrings, will create an explicit PDF. Afterwards, there should be information about the location of the code repository; additionally, there should be detailed instructions on how to run the project.
In this article, We will look into the file documentation which is generated by Sphinx. This documentation generator can be used to create .pdf, .HTML or publish the technical documentation page to a Confluence instance.
